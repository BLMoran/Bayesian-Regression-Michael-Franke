The first part introduces the basics of BDA and linear regression modeling.

<!-- Here are [slides for session 1](slides/01-intro-simpleRegress.pdf). -->

There are five mostly self-contained tutorials, covering:

1. basics of data wrangling (in the `tidyverse`) and plotting (with `ggplot2`),
2. simple linear regression models (with `brms`),
3. how to specify priors in `brms`,
4. why and how to inspect a model's predictive distribution(s),
5. contrast coding of categorical predictor variables.

There is also a sheet with additional exercises (simple linear regression with metric and categorical variables).

There is also a sort of "cheat sheet" with common operations and functions when working with `brms`.
