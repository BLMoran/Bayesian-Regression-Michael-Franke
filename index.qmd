title: "Bayesian Regression: Theory & Practice"

This site provides material for an introductory to intermediate level course on Bayesian linear regression modeling.
The course presupposes some prior exposure to statistics and some acquaintance with R.

## Intended audience

This course with people in mind who have a completed a first, introductory course on data analysis, which has conveyed roughly the following: 

- basic knowledge of R and, ideally, the tidyverse
- basic familiarity with Bayesian reasoning (prior, likelihood, posterior)
- some prior exposure to regression modeling (ideally from a Bayesian point of view)

## Scope

The aim of this course is to take students from beginner to intermediate Bayesian regression modeling. 
The course focuses on Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear models as implemented in the `brms` package.
It covers the following theoretical and practical aspects:

- prior and posterior model checking
- generalized linear models (ordered logit, multinomial, Poisson, Beta ...)
- MCMC methods (HMC diagnostics)
- contrast coding for categorical predictors
- missing data
- distributional and non-linear models (GAMs, Gaussian processes)
- model comparison (Bayes factors, cross-validation)

## Additional material

An even more basic introduction to data analysis (introducing R, tidyverse, Bayesian and, eventually, also frequentist statistics) is the webbook ["An introduction to Data Analysis"](https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/index.html).
This course presupposes roughly the content covered in Chapters 2--9 and 12--13.

Part of the hands-on material was used in a previous course, co-taught with the great Timo Roettger.
My gratitude for his permission to build on it here.
